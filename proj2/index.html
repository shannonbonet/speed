        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In section 1, we implemented and observed the result of evaluating Bezier curves and surfaces
            using de Casteljau's algorithm given a set of control points. Later, we learned to understand and
            manipulate triangle meshes and the half-edge data structure in order to render 3D objects.
            We implemented Phong shading, which 'smoothed' the shading of 3D objects, as well as manipulated
            edges to later perform loop subdivision to create higher dimension meshes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The visual nature of this project and being able to actually interact with what we built was
            particularly interesting and rewarding, and made the process of understanding these concepts
            much easier and more fun!

        <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>

        <p>
            De Casteljau’s algorithm is a method for evaluating a Bezier curve recursively.
            This is done by defining n control points on a curve, then recursively linearly interpolating
            n – 1 points until there is 1 point left. Our implementation executes one recursive step in de
            Casteljau’s algorithm by calling a lerp function on pairs of adjacent points until we arrive at a
            final point on the Bezier curve. Below are the steps to evaluating a Bezier curve with 6 control points.

        <p>
            De Casteljau’s algorithm can be extended to evaluate points on a Bezier Surface. The process is very similar to evaluating in 1D,
            but now we use 2 parameters, u and v, to represent a position on a surface. In our evaluate function, we iterate through each row
            of control points and define a Bezier curve parameterized by u. Then, we consider all points for all n rows and define a Bezier curve
            defined by v.

        <b>
            Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
        </b>
        <p>
            To implement area-weighted vertex normals, we started by creating a do while loop that would iterate through all halfedges with this vertex as the source. This mimicked the printNeighborPositions(...) function in the primer by iterating through the halfedge's twin's next halfedge, which would let us access each face.
            For each face, we found the three verticies that made up that face by accessing the vertex position of the halfedge (A), its next (B), and its next next (C). Then, we found the area of the face made up of those three vertices by taking the cross product of AB and AC, then taking half the square root of each dimension squared. This gave us the area as a float. We then multiplied the normal by the area and added that to a running sum vector N.
            We then returned the normalized sum of the area-weighted normals by dividing N by N.norm().

            For parts 4 and 5, we followed the <a href="http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015content/misc/HalfedgeEdgeOpImplementationGuide.pdf">Guide to Implementing Edge Operations</a> that was shared in Ed.
            For this part, we understood and used the provided diagrams. Essentially, this meant identifying and assigning names to all of the halfedges, vertices, edges, and faces in the before diagram. We also checked isBoundar() on both of the faces, and returned EdgeIter() if this was the case.
            Then, we exhaustively updated the pointers of all elements, using setNeighbors() for the halfedges, and assigning an appropriate halfedge() for each vertex, edge, and face.
            We fortunately didn't run into much headache debugging this at all, other than one more careful check to make sure the elements were assigned correctly. (One was off, but fixing that one made it work!)

        <p>
            We followed the same general guide in part 5, but had to create our own diagram for the before/after. The actual code was very similar - the main difference was just allocating the 6 new halfedges, 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, and 2 new faces. We set the position of the new vertex to the midpoint of the original edge by taking half the sum of the two vertices' positions.
            The reassignment process was also similar and methodical. Debugging this one was more tricky - we realized after a first pass that our original after diagram wasn't quite accurate. We created a new one from scratch, this time preserving as much of the original diagram as possible (things like the 'outside' halfedges and edges remaining where they were), and it worked. We kept old elements where they were and added new elements where needed.

        </b>
        <p>
            The debugging process wasn't too bad - the main issue we had was just that nothing seemed to work at all the first time! At first, we thought the issue might have been with setting the new vector, but after printing the positions of the vertices and the new vertex, that didn't seem to be the issue.
            Ultimately, retrying the diagram and taking more care to preserve the locations of unchanged elements did the trick.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
        <p>
            We implemented loop subdivision via the recommended way of first calculating new positions on edges and new positions of old vertices,
            then traversing the original mesh to subdivide with edgeSplit and edgeFlip, then finally updating position values of the resulting mesh.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main bug we encountered was flipping the wrong edge, resulting in weird image results. Originally,
            we made the mistake of assuming that whenever a new edge was split, the next edge in iteration would be the
            2nd half of the original edge we just divided. It turns out that any new edges created are added to the back
            of the edge iterator. Additionally, we were also very confused on which edges to mark new and when, since the splitEdge
            function simply returned the new vertex and there wasn’t a clear way to track which edges were new or old. We ended
            up having to revisit Task 5 and update the relevant edges, which wasn’t immediately obvious to us. Then, we just
            ensured that the correct edge to flip was 1. a new edge and 2. connected by 1 new vertex and 1 old vertex.
        </p>
        <br />


        <p>
            After loop subdivision, we noticed how sharp corners and edges get more rounded,
            and sometimes resulted in a slightly ‘fuzzier’ and lopsided effect in
            that part of the image. We noticed that if we manually pre-split some edges, we can reduce this effect before
            upsampling.

        <p>
             Similarly, subdividing the cube with no pre-processing gives an asymmetrical result. This asymmetry happens due to the
             fact that the original cube faces are only split once along the diagonal, which results in a slightly lopsided cube
             after several upsamples.
